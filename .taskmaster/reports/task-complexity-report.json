		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Git Repository and Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Git repository initialization into specific steps: repository creation, directory structure setup, README creation, gitignore configuration, and initial commit preparation.",
			"reasoning": "This is a foundational task with clear, sequential steps. Low complexity due to standard Git operations, but critical for project setup. Each step is distinct and can be validated independently."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Generate Spring Boot Backend Project",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Spring Boot project generation into: Spring Initializr configuration, project generation and extraction, dependency verification, package structure creation, README setup, and build validation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving specific Spring Boot configuration and Gradle setup. Multiple verification steps required. Dependencies and build configuration can be tricky for newcomers."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Backend Health Check API Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split the health check implementation into: controller class creation, endpoint implementation with proper annotations, CORS configuration, and endpoint testing and validation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity requiring Spring Boot knowledge, REST controller patterns, and CORS understanding. Involves both implementation and configuration aspects that need separate attention."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Generate React Frontend Project",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down React project creation into: Vite project initialization, dependency installation and verification, project structure validation, README creation, and development server testing.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with modern React tooling (Vite). Straightforward but requires familiarity with Node.js ecosystem and project structure validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Frontend Development Proxy",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide proxy configuration into: Vite config modification for proxy setup, proxy rule configuration and testing, CORS validation, and integration testing with both servers running.",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to network configuration and potential debugging challenges. Proxy setup can be tricky and requires understanding of development server configurations and CORS policies."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Frontend Health Check Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the health check integration into: React component creation with hooks, API fetch implementation, error and loading state handling, component integration in App.jsx, and styling and user experience enhancements.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity involving React hooks, async operations, error handling, and state management. Requires good understanding of React patterns and API integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize documentation creation into: root README with project overview and quick start, backend-specific documentation with API details, frontend documentation with development guide, and troubleshooting and validation sections.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity requiring thorough understanding of the entire project to write accurate documentation. Time-consuming but straightforward. Quality depends on completeness and accuracy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Logging",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide error handling implementation into: backend global exception handling setup, backend logging configuration, frontend ErrorBoundary component creation, frontend API error handling, development logging setup, and error scenario testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving both backend and frontend error handling patterns. Requires knowledge of Spring Boot exception handling, React error boundaries, and logging frameworks. Critical for application stability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Add Development Environment Validation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down environment validation into: backend environment check script creation, frontend environment check script creation, package.json validation scripts, Docker containerization setup, IDE configuration files, CI/CD preparation, and cross-platform testing.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity involving multiple technologies, scripting, containerization, and IDE configurations. Requires broad knowledge of development tools and environments. Many moving parts that need coordination."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize and Test Complete Integration",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize final integration into: comprehensive end-to-end testing, cross-browser and environment testing, production build optimization, security configuration review, performance testing and optimization, code review and cleanup, release tagging and versioning, and deployment documentation preparation.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity as it encompasses testing, optimization, security, and deployment preparation. Requires deep understanding of the entire system and production readiness concerns. Multiple specialized areas of expertise needed."
